[ACKNOWLEDGMENTS]{.smallcaps}

I would like to acknowledge Matthew Davis, Chief Product Engineer at PTZOptics, who helped create the foundation for visual reasoning technology. His vision for connecting AI to PTZ cameras made this book possible.

I also want to thank Brian Mulcahy, whose work on the Visual Reasoning Harness has made these tools accessible to professionals who aren't programmers.

And to the Moondream team—Jay and Vik—for building an open-source vision model that makes all of this affordable and practical for real-world deployments.

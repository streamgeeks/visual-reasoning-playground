# The Visual Reasoning Principles

Visual Reasoning transforms cameras from passive recorders into intelligent teammates. It connects robotic cameras, cloud, and AI to analyze live video and trigger real-time actions—automating workflows and solving real-world problems across every industry.

But Visual Reasoning is more than a product. It's a movement.

**We believe in:**

- **Real outcomes over AI slogans.** If it doesn't solve a concrete problem, it doesn't matter.
- **Open ecosystems over closed stacks.** Open APIs let anyone build on this foundation.
- **Human agency over black-box automation.** AI should augment people, not erase them.
- **Everyday wins over sci-fi promises.** The mundane victories matter—one fewer crew member needed, three hours saved in editing, a school that can finally cover every game.
- **Education before monetization.** We lead with free tools, documentation, and courses that teach how to build these systems.
- **Responsible deployment by design.** Privacy, security, and data ownership are not bolt-ons.

This is a shared movement, not a single platform. PTZOptics, Moondream, StreamGeeks—we're contributors, not owners. The harness, the playground, the educational materials—these belong to everyone who wants to make video automatically actionable.
